# Dependency Injection in Rust Design

This document considers several designs for implementing
[Dependency Injection](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) in Rust.

## Goals

Listed in [Â§Desired Features in Requirements.md](Requirements.md#desired-features)

## Existing Approaches

* [Context-Generic Programming Patterns (DRAFT)](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/introduction.html)
  * A service is defined as a trait.
  * CGP prefers to inject individual functions, rather than services grouping a
    number of them.  This allows partial implementations of 'a traditional'
    service that can be used by a client which requires only functions in the
    partial implementation.
  * Another trait
    (['DelegateComponent'](https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/provider-delegation.html#using-delegatecomponent))
    is defined for each service. It delegates calling a service method to
    calling that method for a parameter type ('Delegate').  Binding a service
    to an implementation is setting the parameter type ('Delegate') to a type
    that implements the service trait.
  * A `struct` associating 'Delegate' types with implementation (provider)
    types is defined to bind multiple services.  This functions as a Dependency
    Injection module.
  * A value of a generic 'Context' type implementing the traits for requsted
    services serves as an injector.
* [std::error::Request](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/struct.Request.html#method.provide_value),
  and [std::error::Error::provide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.provide)
  * A [`request_ref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/fn.request_ref.html), and
    a [`request_value`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/fn.request_value.html)
    function is used to request (inject) a value (service) of a given type, or
    a reference to it.
  * The result is `Option<T>`, or `Option<&'a T>`, since the injector (`Error`)
    is allowed to not be able to provide a given service at a given time.
  * A [`provide` method](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.provide)
    binds request types to injected values.
  * Each binding is performed by calling
    [`Request::provide_value<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/struct.Request.html#method.provide_value),
    or
    [`Request::provide_ref<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/struct.Request.html#method.provide_ref).
  * The current implementation uses
    [`std::any::TypeId`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/struct.TypeId.html)
    to produce a (128-bit) unique ID for each type argument passed to
    `request_ref`, or `request_value`.  The ID is used to create a `Request`
    struct which can store and retrieve a value of only the given type
    argument.
    * A call to `Request::provide_value<T>`, or `Request::provide_ref<T>`
      creates a `Request` that stores the value passed to it only if it has a
      matching type ID.
    * `request_ref<'a, T>` and `request_value<'a, T>` call `Error::provide`
      with a `Request` matching only `T`.  Then, `Error::provide` calls
      `request::provide_value`, `request::provide_ref`, or etc. for each value
      that the `Error`-implementing object knows how to provide.  Only a call
      with a matching type ID stores a provided value.  All the other
      `request::provide_*` calls have no effect.  If a value with a matching
      type ID was stored in the `Request` object, `request_ref` or
      `request_value` returns it as `Some(injected_result)`.  If no such value
      was stored, it returns `None`.
* [Pavex](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/pavex/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md)
  uses its own build tool in order to perform code generation before building.  It
  uses the 'classic' style of listing injected services as function
  parameters.  It allows using a service trait in the place of a type in the
  function parameter declaration.  Service bindings are generated from a
  'Blueprint' file, and by analyzing type signatures, annotations (Rust
  procedural macro results) and other output from `rustdoc`.  See
  [Reasoning about Rust: an introduction to Rustdoc's JSON format - Luca Palmieri - EuroRust 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxQYyg_v3rw).
* Other Dependency Injection crates.  Many of them try to bring code to an object-oriented
  approach.

## Design

### Service Interface

```rust
pub trait GetUrl {
    type Url;
    type HttpResponse;
    type Error;

    fn get_url(
        &self,
        url: &Self::Url,
    ) -> impl Future<Output = Result<Self::HttpResponse, Self::Error>>;
}
```

A service would then be represented by a generic type implementing the service
trait (`T: GetUrl`), or by a trait object (e.g., `&impl GetUrl`).

```rust
fn use_generic_type<GetUrlService: GetUrl>(
  get_url_service: &mut GetUrlService
) {
    let result = get_url_service.get_url(&Url::from("https://very-interesting.org"));
    // . . .
}

fn use_trait_object(get_url_service: &mut impl GetUrl) {
    let result = get_url_service.get_url(&Url::from("https://very-interesting.org"));
    // . . .
}
```

### Service Client Options

#### Explicit Service Arguments (including Constructor Injection)

```rust
async fn calculate_web_page_message_digest<
    HttpClientService: GetUrl,
    MessageDigestService: NewDigestCalculator,
>(
    http_client_service: &mut HttpClientService,
    message_digest_service: &mut MessageDigestService,
    url: &Url,
) -> Result<Digest, Error>
where
    HttpClientService::HttpResponse: IntoChunkStream,
    MessageDigestService::DigestCalculator:
        IntoDigestOctets<DigestOctets = Digest> + Write,
{
    let mut digest_calculator = message_digest_service.new_digest_calculator()?;
    let mut chunk_stream = http_client_service
        .get_url(url)
        .await?
        .into_chunk_stream();

    while let Some(chunk_result) = chunk_stream.next().await {
        let chunk = chunk_result?;
        digest_calculator.write_all(&chunk)?;
    }

    Ok(digest_calculator.into_digest_octets()?)
}
```

* Keeping track of numerous parameters may get laborious.
* Allows manual binding for each call, or generating code for constructing
  each injected parameter.  E.g.,

  ```rust
  // Generated from the signature of `calculate_web_page_message_digest`:
  async fn calculate_web_page_message_digest_with_injector<
      Injector: InjectGetUrlService + InjectNewDigestCalculatorService,
  >(
      injector: &mut Injector,
      url: &Url,
  ) -> Result<Digest, Error>
  where
      <<Injector as InjectGetUrlService>::Service as HttpClientService>::HttpResponse:
          IntoChunkStream,
      <<Injector as InjectNewDigestCalculatorService>::Service as MessageDigestService>::DigestCalculator:
          IntoDigestOctets<DigestOctets = Digest> + Write,
  {
      let mut http_client_service = InjectGetUrlService::inject(injector);
      let mut message_digest_service = InjectNewDigestCalculatorService::inject(injector);

      calculate_web_page_message_digest(
          &mut http_client_service,
          &mut message_digest_service,
          url,
      )
  }
  ```

### Explicit Injector Argument

This is (essentially)
[the generated `. . . _with_injector` function from Explicit Service Arguments (including Constructor Injection)](#explicit-service-arguments-including-constructor-injection).

```rust
fn calculate_web_page_message_digest_with_injector<
    Injector: InjectGetUrlService + InjectNewDigestCalculatorService,
>(
    injector: &mut Injector,
    url: &Url,
) -> Result<Digest, Error>
where
    <<Injector as InjectGetUrlService>::Service as GetUrl>::HttpResponse:
        IntoChunkStream,
    <<Injector as InjectNewDigestCalculatorService>::Service as NewDigestCalculator>::DigestCalculator:
        IntoDigestOctets<DigestOctets = Digest> + Write,
{
    let mut message_digest_service = InjectNewDigestCalculatorService::inject(injector);
    let mut digest_calculator = message_digest_service.new_digest_calculator()?;

    let mut http_client_service = InjectGetUrlService::inject(injector);
    let mut chunk_stream = http_client_service
        .get_url(url)
        .await?
        .into_chunk_stream();

    while let Some(chunk_result) = chunk_stream.next().await {
        let chunk = chunk_result?;
        digest_calculator.write_all(&chunk)?;
    }

    Ok(digest_calculator.into_digest_octets()?)
}
```

* Reduced number of call parameters.
* Injectors can be shared among calls (without repeating each argument
  construction).
* Overriding a specific service requires a new injector.
* Allows accomodating run-time injection features.
  * An injector can change the value it returns for a `Service::inject(injector)`
    call at run time.
  * Defining `inject_fallible(&mut self) -> Result<Self::Service, Error>` can
    accomodate injection that can fail at run time.
  * Similarly, `inject_optional(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Service>` can
    accomodate injecting a service that may not be available at a given time during
    application execution.
* Asynchronous injection can be similarly accomodated.
* The above run-time features can also be implemented by the generated
  `. . . _with_injector` function.

### Explicit All-Services Argument

This is the style that CGP uses.  There's one object of a generic 'Context' type
passed to a client function.  The 'context' object implements all services that the
client requires.

```rust
// [AllServicesObject] is usually named `Context` in CGP.
fn calculate_web_page_message_digest_with_all_services_object<
    AllServicesObject: GetUrl + NewDigestCalculator,
>(
    all_services_object: &mut AllServicesObject,
    url: &Url,
) -> Result<Digest, Error>
where
    <AllServicesObject as GetUrl>::HttpResponse:
        IntoChunkStream,
    <AllServicesObject as NewDigestCalculatorService>::DigestCalculator:
        IntoDigestOctets<DigestOctets = Digest> + Write,
{
    let mut digest_calculator = all_services_object.new_digest_calculator()?;
    let mut chunk_stream = all_services_object
        .get_url(url)
        .await?
        .into_chunk_stream();

    while let Some(chunk_result) = chunk_stream.next().await {
        let chunk = chunk_result?;
        digest_calculator.write_all(&chunk)?;
    }

    Ok(digest_calculator.into_digest_octets()?)
}
```

* Can be added as a trait to `Self`.  This allows adding services to methods,
  and removing them without changing the number of arguments.
* Overriding an individual service requires a new type, possibly forwarding
  all but one services methods to the previous all-services object.
* The services required by a function can still be discovered from the list of
  super-traits in the signature (`GetUrl + NewDigestCalculator`).
* Listing the services required by a function is shorter than having a type
  parameter for each service.
* Changing bindings at run time can still be accomodated by appropriately
  instantiating an all-services object that forwards calls to service objects
  constructed at run time.
* Fallible, and optional injections can be similarly implemented.
* Compared to having a separate argument for each service, this is a trade-off
  between passing less arguments in a function call, and generating less
  template code for accessing each service.

### Using Implementation-Independent Macros

Another approach is to try to express the intent of a service, and a consumer
in a way that allows code for any of the above implementations to be
generated.  This would look more like a Domain-Specific Language processed,
e.g. by macro expansion with some configuration for what code to generate.

```rust
[#(di_service)]
trait CalculateWebPageMessageDigest {
    #[
        associated_types(Error),
        inject(
            http_client_service: &mut impl GetUrl,
            message_digest_service: &mut impl NewDigestCalculator,
        )
    ]
    async fn calculate_web_page_message_digest(
        url: &Url,
    ) -> Result<Digest, Associated::Error> {
        let mut digest_calculator = message_digest_service.new_digest_calculator()?;
        let mut chunk_stream = http_client_service
            .get_url(url)
            .await?
            .into_chunk_stream();

        while let Some(chunk_result) = chunk_stream.next().await {
            let chunk = chunk_result?;
            digest_calculator.write_all(&chunk)?;
        }

        Ok(digest_calculator.into_digest_octets()?)
    }
}
```

## Challenges

* Currently (in 2025) existing library functions, and common idioms, such as
  `async` functions can have return types that cannot be named.  (E.g., see
  [Announcing `async fn` and return-position `impl Trait` in traits](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits/).)
  This can make wrapping existing libraries, or `async` functions as
  injectable service traits with a standardized structure that allows, e.g.
  requesting additional traits for a return type rather difficult.
  * E.g.:

    ```rust
    pub trait GetUrl {
        // We may have a standardized structure for traits that expose a
        // function, in which the function parameter, and return types are
        // accessible:
        type Url;
        type Output;

        // Currently, an `async` function declaration is syntactic sugar for a
        // function with a return type that `impl Future`, but cannot be
        // named.  This gets in the way of writing code that may, or may not
        // require additional constraints, such as `Send` for the returned
        // future. 
        fn get_url(&self, url: &Self::Url) -> Self::Output;
    }

    // There's currently no way to `impl GetUrl for UrlGetService` that looks
    // like the following in stable Rust.
    struct UrlGetService {}

    impl GetUrl for UrlGetService {
        type Url = reqwest::Url;

        // This currently requires unstable Rust:
        type Output = impl Future<Output = Result<reqwest::Response, reqwest::Error>>;

        async fn get_url(
            &self,
            url: &Self::Url
        ) -> Result<Self::HttpResponse, Self::Error> {
            reqwest::get(url.clone()).await
        }
    }
    ```

    * See
      [Async in public trait](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/async-in-public-trait/108400),
      and
      [Crate trait_variant](https://docs.rs/trait-variant/latest/trait_variant/)
      for more details.
* Assembling a list of service implementations (called
  [Multibindings](https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/multibindings.html) in Dager)
  is not straightforward because
  ([macro invocations are not intended to have state](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9084#issuecomment-778687670)).
  * Outputting `const` expressions that add to a collection from a macro may work.
  * The [inventory crate](https://crates.io/crates/inventory) has such an
    approach, but const evaluation seems to be a challenge.  The
    [linkme crate](https://crates.io/crates/linkme) relies on a linker to
    assemble the result, and doesn't seem to support WebAssemby.
  * A
    [crate build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-script-examples.html)
    is an option, but it may require re-scanning all code to function
    properly, and
    [generating crate dependencies would currently not work](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-script-examples.html).
